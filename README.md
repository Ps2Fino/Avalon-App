# Avalon-App

I really like the game [Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon).
I mean, REALLY like it!
I play it as often as I can.

However, sometimes the callout can be tricky to remember as the game grows: for example, games with Merlin, Percival and Oberon for example.
This application automates the callout.
Players can choose which characters are active in the game, and then the app will generate a sound clip of the callout and then play it.

This project is [Updater](https://github.com/Ps2Fino/Updater) compatible.
