# Avalon-App

I really like the game [Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon).
I mean, REALLY like it!
I play it as often as I can.

However, sometimes the callout can be tricky to remember as the game grows: for example, games with Merlin, Percival and Oberon.
This application automates the callout.
Players can choose which characters are active in the game, and then the app will generate a sound clip of the callout and then play it.
For the moment, the app uses a TTS plugin for the speech output.

This project is [Updater](https://github.com/Ps2Fino/Updater) compatible.

# Dependencies
As of v03-alpha, the android version uses [Hosein Porazar's Andoid TTS Plugin](https://github.com/HoseinPorazar/Android-Native-TTS-plugin-for-Unity-3d/tree/Modified) for text-to-speech conversion of the callout.
I've placed a [packaged binary](https://github.com/Ps2Fino/Avalon-App/releases/tag/v0.2.1-android-alpha) in the releases.
